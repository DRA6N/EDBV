# Elite: Dangerous Bindings Viewer
---
EDBV is a tool used to view your current bindings in Elite Dangerous.
Rather than having to scroll through your bindings in-game or use an EDRefCard to figure out what your current bindings are, EDBV fills that void.

## How to use this app:
1. Set your bindings directory under File > Settings > Set Bindings Directory.
2. Use the dropdown to switch between different .binds files.
3. Use the search bar to filter by action, area, or category.
4. Enable 'Show Unbound' to highlight unbound commands.


#### _Note: Bindings are typically located in the C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Local\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Bindings directory._
